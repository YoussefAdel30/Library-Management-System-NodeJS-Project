# Library-Management-System-NodeJS-Project
A RESTful API for managing books, borrowers, and borrowing processes in a library. Built with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and PostgreSQL. Supports CRUD operations, search, overdue tracking, CSV/XLSX exports, authentication, rate limiting, Docker setup, Swagger docs, and unit tests for core features.



Important Notes
Sensitive data and secrets are included directly in the application properties for simplicity. In a production environment, these should be kept in a secured place such as a vault or AWS Parameter Store and set from those secured stores.
URL paths specified in the task may not be strictly followed, but similar functionality has been implemented with DTOs for future flexibility without changing the URL.
