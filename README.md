## Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YoussefAdel30/Library-Management-System-NodeJS-Project
cd <your-project-folder>
```


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Application
```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```
#### OR
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
but if you found problems like npm install command is cached go with the first one.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run Unit Tests
```bash
docker compose run --rm app npm test -- --runInBand --colors
```
#### Note
Tests run automatically when the system starts, but their logs are not displayed. To view the test results, run the command above manually.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Stop the Application
```bash
docker compose down
```

## After Bootup Steps
### Setup
On application start, the database is created using migration scripts.

The system has a single user for authentication, which can access all endpoints using **Basic Authentication** (either via Postman or Swagger):

- **Username:** admin  
- **Password:** securepassword123

### Try the APIs
#### Using Postman Collection
1Ô∏è‚É£ Import the collection and environments files which are present in the "postman" directory.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Click on the right icon of the enviroment .json to activate the enviroment variables.
3Ô∏è‚É£ After using the enviroment variable (user and pass), you can now hit any API smoothly.
4Ô∏è‚É£ If you face any problems importing the collection and environments, go with swagger approach.But , you will be asked to enter credentials manually which is provided above.

#### Swagger to Directly Execute Requests
1Ô∏è‚É£ Access Swagger at: http://localhost:5000/api-docs
2Ô∏è‚É£ You can now use Swagger to execute requests directly. But, at your first request you will be asked to enter Credentials which is provided above.









# Important Notes
* Sensitive data and secrets are included directly in the application properties for simplicity. In a production environment, these should be kept in a secured place such as a vault or AWS Parameter Store and set from those secured stores.
